20 Things I learned About Browsers And The Web
===============================================

Thing 1: What is the Internet? 
-------------------------------
* Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) - created a set of rules that allowed computers to "talk" to each other and send information back and forth.
* Early Internet creators discoverd that data/info could be sent more efficiently when broken ingo smaller chunks, sent seperately, and reassembled - those chunks are called "packets".
* Bandwidth - the amount of data that can be sent over your Internet connection per second. Indication of how fast your connection is. 
* The Internet is a highly tehnical system that has been abstracted and made user friendly... it's the backbone that allows the "World Wide Web" to exist.

Thing 2: Cloud Computing 
-------------------------------
* "Or, why it's okay for a truck to crush your laptop"...
* Data is migrating beyond the boudaries of our personal computers -> we're moving our data online into "the cloud".
* Cloud computing = storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of on your computer's hard drive. Instead of storing your data locally on hard drives, CDs, and "floppy disks", you're now able to upload your data to "the cloud" which basically means copying and storing your data in Google's/Amazon's whoevers' "server farms" where it's backed up in multiple locations.
* This allows you to access data on any Internet capable device - where it appears to be running on your local device but is actually running over the Internet on an array of computers that are sharing resources. 
* "The cloud" = metaphor for the gigantic server farm infrastructure of the Internet. With cloud computing data is still stored on physical servers, just not your local harddrive.
* Benefits of cloud computing: 
    * Pay only for what you use.
    * No local server space or expert knowledge required.
    * Better data security and recovery in case of disasters.
    * High flexibility and automatic software updates.
