20 Things I learned About Browsers And The Web
===============================================

Thing 1: What is the Internet? 
-------------------------------
* Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) - created a set of rules that allowed computers to "talk" to each other and send information back and forth.
* Early Internet creators discoverd that data/info could be sent more efficiently when broken ingo smaller chunks, sent seperately, and reassembled - those chunks are called "packets".
* Bandwidth - the amount of data that can be sent over your Internet connection per second. Indication of how fast your connection is. 
* The Internet is a highly tehnical system that has been abstracted and made user friendly... it's the backbone that allows the "World Wide Web" to exist.

Thing 2: Cloud Computing 
-------------------------------
* "Or, why it's okay for a truck to crush your laptop"...
* Data is migrating beyond the boudaries of our personal computers -> we're moving our data online into "the cloud".
* Cloud computing = storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of on your computer's hard drive. Instead of storing your data locally on hard drives, CDs, and "floppy disks", you're now able to upload your data to "the cloud" which basically means copying and storing your data in Google's/Amazon's whoevers' "server farms" where it's backed up in multiple locations.
* This allows you to access data on any Internet capable device - where it appears to be running on your local device but is actually running over the Internet on an array of computers that are sharing resources. 
* "The cloud" = metaphor for the gigantic server farm infrastructure of the Internet. With cloud computing data is still stored on physical servers, just not your local harddrive.
* Benefits of cloud computing: 
    * Pay only for what you use.
    * No local server space or expert knowledge required.
    * Better data security and recovery in case of disasters.
    * High flexibility and automatic software updates.

Thing 3: Web Apps
-------------------------------
* Application === program === software
* Web apps - software programs typically focused on a single task that run in the browser and often provide a rich, interactive experience (ex: Google Maps).
* The 4 virtues of web apps: 
    1. I can access my data from anywhere. All data is stored online on the web. 
    2. I'll always get the latest version of any app. Web apps update themselves automatically.
    3. It works on every device with a web browser; the web is an open platform. 
    4. It's safer - web apps run in the brower; separation between app code and local computer code. 

Thing 4: HTML, CSS, Javascript and More
-------------------------------
* HTML - tells browsers how to structure and present content on s web page. 
* Idea of dynamic web pages began with invention of scripting language Javascript... dynamic web truly came to life when XHR (XMLHttpRequest) was introduced into Javascript - enabled individual parts of a web page to be altered without needing to reload the entire page. 
* AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) - method of building interactive web apps that process user requests immediately; combination of Javascript, XHR, CSS and several other web technologies. 

Thing 5: HTML5
-------------------------------
* HTML5 = latest version of HTML, includes new features: 
    * <video> tag.
    * Offline capabilities. 
    * Drag and drop.

Thing 6: 3D in the Browser
-------------------------------
* Now possible to send large amounts of data over the internet, enabling features such as realistic 3D experiences in the browser. 
* Also made possible by advancements in the web browser's capabilities (e.g. WebGL, 3D CSS, hardware acceleration).

Thing 7: A Browser Madrigal
-------------------------------
* Using old, out-of-date browsers can be problematic and potentially dangerous. 
* Important to update to a modern browser for 3 reasons: 
     1. Old browsers are vulnerable to attacks.
     2. Many new features on today's wesites/web apps won't work in old browsers. 
     3. Old browsers slow down innovation; if many users cling to old browsers, developers are forced to design websites that work with both old and new tech - end up developing for the lowest common denominator. 

Thing 8: Plugins
-------------------------------
* Plug-in =  additional piece of software that specializes in processing particular types of content. 
* Plug-ins hardly interface with the browser - means they can work across many different browsers but makes them prime targets for browser security attacks.

Thing 9: Browser Extensions
-------------------------------
* Let you add new features to your browser - literally extending your browser. "Superpowers for your browser".
* Can also act on their own, outside of web pages (working in the background).
* We can now write extensions in HYTML, Javascript and CSS.

Thing 10: Synchronizing the Browser
-------------------------------
* "Or, why it's ok for a truck to crush your laptop, part II".
* Modern browsers now include synchronization/"sync" - lets you save your browser settings online in the cloud so they aren't lost even if your computer melts down; changes are reflected between all devices. 

Thing 11: Browser Cookies
-------------------------------
* Cookie = small text files stored within a browser; small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit; contains information about your visit that you may want the site to remember (e.g. preferred language). 
* Browser stores this data and pulls it out the next time you visit the site to make your next trip easier and more personalized (tailored suggestions/ads, online shopping carts etc.).
* HTTP = stateless. Cookies provide a way for servers to indetify/remember WHO is making the current request along with other personalized info. When you visit a website using cookies, that site's server responds with both the content AND a cookie (small text file serving as a unique identifier) that is stored in the brower and submitted to the server with every additional request you make to that website. 
* Scrutinized for potentially compromising user privacy.

Thing 12: Browsers and Privacy
-------------------------------
* Security and privacy are not the same - privacy features help keep your browsing private on your computer. Can clear browser data, use "incognito" mode, and manages cookies in browser prefernces. 

Thing 12: Malware, Phishing and Security Risks
-------------------------------
