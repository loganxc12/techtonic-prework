BASIC INTERNET TERMINOLOGY AND UNDERSTANDING
============================================

INTERNET
------------
    * A very large network of computers connected to each other. 
    * Like a road network - no actual center:
        * Cables = "roads", computers = "houses", information = "cars"
    * Invented in 1969.

    * Usually, a connection on the internet takes place between 2 computers only:
        1. Server - HAS the information; where info is stored, sole purpose is to DELIVER CONTENT.
        2. Client - WANTS the information; program that can take many forms: web browser, email, client, messenger app, video streaming service... 

IP ADDRESS 
------------
    * A combination of numbers (like 91.198.174.192) which acts like a UNIQIUE IDETIFIER for a computer connected to the Internet.
    * Hard to read for humans, so domains were created...

DOMAINS 
------------
    * Text which acts as a unique identifier for a computer connected to the Internet. 
    * Associate an IP address with a string of text, interchangable: 
        * https://91.198.174.192 === https://wikipedia.com
    * Made of 3 parts, read right to left: 
        1. Top Level Domain (TLD) - .com, .net, .org, .us, .fr etc.
        2. Domain Name - wikipedia, facebook etc. Can include letters and numbers but no space or dot.
        3. Subdomain - Optional, most websites use www.
    * Can't buy domains, only rent them from domain registrars. 

PROTOCOL
------------
    * A set of rules, like a language, in which computers communicate with each other:
        * FTP - file transfer.
        * SMTP - sending emails.
        * IMAP - receiving emails.
        * IRC - chat.
        * HTTP - browsing HTML documents (webpages).

URL 
------------
    * Uniform Resource Locator - unique and defines where to find something on the internet and how the computer is supposed to read it, made of 3 parts: 
        1. Protocol - https://
        2. Domain - wikipedia.com
        3. Path - /cheese.html
